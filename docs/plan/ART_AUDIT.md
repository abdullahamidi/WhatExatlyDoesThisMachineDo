# Art Audit — drive train + scene (Phase 1, audit only)

Evidence (scratch, not committed): `.../scratchpad/ad/aud.png`, `aud-zoom.png`, 3× crops `c-left.png` (motor/crank/pinion),
`c-mid.png` (gears), `c-fly.png` (flywheel), `c-top.png` (pistons), `assets4x.png`; user shot `images/1.png`.
Coordinates: machine-local art px, origin = frame base centre, +y down (ground y=0). PIXEL_SCALE 2.
Measured frame: posts x −100..−93, −36..−27, 29..38, 94..99; X-brace gussets centred (−64,−56), (0,−56), (65,−56);
top girder y −110..−95; bottom girder y −14..−2.

## 1. Reference rules (research)
- R1 Side elevation: every axle points into the screen, so a shaft is seen **end-on as a dot/cap**, never as a line between
  two wheel centres. Lines between wheels can only be belts, rods (pin-to-pin) or nothing (gear mesh).
- R2 Open belt = two external tangent spans + wrap arcs on the **outside** of each pulley; small pulley wrap = 180°−2β,
  large = 180°+2β, β = asin((R−r)/C); min wrap ≈120° on the small pulley. Open belt: both pulleys turn the same way;
  ω_driven = ω_driver·r_driver/r_driven. Flat belts ride crowned pulley rims.

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_(mechanical), https://www.firgelliauto.com/blogs/mechanisms/plain-pulley-for-flat-belt)
- R3 Gears mesh only with **equal module/pitch**; pitch circles tangent, centre distance = Rp1+Rp2; ratio = z2/z1, opposite
  rotation. (https://akbis.gaziantep.edu.tr/yonetim/upload/files/4841-5608.pdf, https://www.elesa-ganter.com/en/TechnicalDataWWW/21-the-tooth-td-013-art-003,
  https://danotes.mech.uwa.edu.au/gears/meshing/meshing.html)
- R4 Shafts sit in bearing housings bolted to a base/pedestal (pillow/plummer block); flywheel is keyed to the crankshaft next
  to a main bearing, belt pulley on flywheel or crankshaft (hit-and-miss / stationary engines).
  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillow_block_bearing, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit-and-miss_engine, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_shaft)
- R5 Crank → connecting rod (rigid, pin at each end) → crosshead/yoke → piston rod; stroke = 2·crank radius, rod ≥ 3× crank
  radius. (https://www.firgelliauto.com/blogs/mechanisms/slider-crank-linkage, https://www.firgelliauto.com/blogs/mechanisms/cross-head-slide)
- R6 Pixel art: one pixel grid for everything; arbitrary-angle runtime rotation causes jaggies (use RotSprite-style pre-rendered
  frames or rotate at native res); gear frames repeat every 360°/z.

## 2. Ranked defects
| # | sev | what (evidence) | why wrong | fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | S1 | `shaft` links drawn as straight bars between centres: crank(−62,−78)→gearSmall(−30,−30); flywheel(150,−48)→piston(76,−118) (c-left, c-fly) | R1: shaft end-on; a bar centre-to-centre is a rigid link that would lock both wheels | delete `shaft` link kind for different axles; co-axial parts share one socket; crank→piston becomes animated `rod` (§3) |
| 2 | S1 | belts are 2 static tangent lines, no wrap arcs, end inside parts: motor r8 at stub tip, gearSmall r7 (inside teeth), gearLarge r14 (mid-spokes), flywheel r24 (mid-spokes) | R2: belt must ride a visible pulley rim and wrap it | add pulley sprites at every belt end; belt = tangents + arcs at r+1; draw above the pulley stack (§3) |
| 3 | S1 | flywheel at (150,−48), r48: rim touches ground y=0, 2 px off frame edge, no axle/bearing/pedestal | R4: floating wheel, reads as cart wheel | A-frame bearing pedestal at x150, hub raised to y −56 (8 px ground clearance), bearing cap on hub |
| 4 | S1 | gears do not mesh: centre dist 46.7, tips 13.6+30.7=44.3 → 2.4 px air gap; large 12T pitch ≈14.7 px vs small 8T ≈9.4 px; brief asked 16/10 | R3 | regen both at module 4 (§4); centre dist 44 exact; phase-lock rotation |
| 5 | S1 | each part rotates on its own speed curve (small 90°/s, large 60°/s, flywheel 120°/s, clamps differ) and pistons have independent phase | ratios break under clamps; teeth interpenetrate; pistons not tied to any crank | one master angle θM; every part = ratio·θM + phase (§3 table); pistons from θM |
| 6 | S1 | motor belt goes to the gear area with no pulley; motor stub bare; motor feet sink 1 px into ground, no plinth | R2/R4 | motor pulley r5 on stub; plinth 48×10; motor centre y −27 |
| 7 | S2 | mixed pixel density: Graphics lines and rotated sprites rasterise at 1 screen px (½ art px); static sprites at 2 (fuzzy flywheel rim c-fly) | R6 | render machine into an art-res RenderTexture (≈420×220, scale 1) shown ×2, NEAREST; links drawn at integer art px (Bresenham) |
| 8 | S2 | link style heavy: width 2–4 + 2 px ink outline = 4–6 art px black bars; depth 15 puts belts **behind** gears | readability; belt hidden at its pulley | belt 2 px, rod 3 px, no extra outline; belts/rods depth above their pulleys (front+1) |
| 9 | S2 | piston-array: 3 non-identical "car pistons" in open air (middle 25% wider), orange valve blob floating, whole sprite incl. bolted base bobs ±3 px | AI-slop asymmetry; static base must not move | split: static `pistonBlock` + moving `pistonYoke`; identical cylinders |
| 10 | S2 | crank + pinion on X-brace with no bearing; crank hub r12.5 hides any pulley | R4 | bearing plates on a new mid-rail; crank pulley r15 > hub |
| 11 | S2 | HUD toasts (y 15–215 screen, x 414–866) cover piston tops (≈y 180) at default camera | focal object hidden | toasts to top-right column x≥900, max 2 visible; or camera focus GROUND_Y−190 |
| 12 | S3 | baked upper-left light rotates with gears/flywheel → highlight orbits | lighting inconsistency | P3: symmetric shading on rotating parts + static rim-light overlay sprite |
| 13 | S3 | ground tile reads top-down (plates ~40 screen px, dark #5f5244 cracks) under a side view; no contact shadows | perspective/scale mismatch, parts float | regen ground foreshortened (plates 3:1, cracks #8a7a64), shadow strips under frame/plinth/pedestal |
| 14 | S3 | pylons layer alpha .75, lattice visible through frame gaps (c-left) competes with truss | depth/clutter | pylons alpha .45 + haze tint; skyline alpha .4 |
| 15 | S3 | frame posts asymmetric (left 8 px, right 6 px); piston base sinks 4 px behind top girder (bed y −106) | AI asymmetry / overlap | inpaint right post to 8 px; bed y −110 |

## 3. Drive-train design (mechanically coherent, valid at every unlock stage)
Power flow: hand crank → pinion P ⇄ large gear on main shaft M; motor → belt → M; M crank pin → conrod → yoke → 3 plungers;
P crank-pulley → belt → flywheel hub pulley on F. Axles end-on, all axle centres in frame on a new horizontal **mid-rail**
(y −59..−53, x −93..28, riveted, part of frame) so every bearing is bolted to steel.

Links (replace `MACHINE_LINKS`; kinds `belt` | `rod`; `shaft` removed, co-axial = same socket):
- belt motorPulley(−114,−31,r5) → mainPulley(−44,−56,r10): C 74.4, β 3.9°, wraps 172°/188°. Crosses left post in front.
- belt crankPulley(0,−56,r15) → flywheelHubPulley(150,−56,r12): C 150, spans at y −72→−69 (top) and −40→−43 (bottom), clear of motor/pistons.
- rod mainPulley.pin (r5 at θM) → yoke pin (−44, y): L = 69, y = −56 − (5cosθ + √(69² − (5sinθ)²)) → range −130..−120; yoke bar −133..−115 clears foot (−114) and cylinders (−136).
Rotation: θM integrates the existing combined speed curve; crank clicks add an impulse to θM. Ratios above; open belts keep
direction, mesh flips it. Gear phase: pinion offset 180°/8 so a tooth sits in a gap at the pitch point (x −16).

Render rules:
- Belt: centreline radius r+1, 2 px thick, outer px #2e1a12, inner px #6e3a22; tangent spans + outside wrap arcs (arc on
  each pulley through the side facing away from the other pulley). Moving dashes: 2 px #8c4a2a every 8 px on inner row,
  offset (ω·r·t) mod 8. Integer art-px raster (Bresenham line + midpoint circle filtered by angle). Depth: above its pulleys.
- Conrod: 3 px bar (#3e4246 / #7d8286 / #3e4246), eyes r2 #5a5f63 with #a3a6a4 centre pixel at both pins; rigid length,
  recomputed per frame. Depth front+1.
- Shaft: never a line; 4×4 cap #a3a6a4 TL px, #7d8286 body, #1f2225 ring, non-rotating.

## 4. New / regenerated assets (PixelLab create_image_pro, palette "Rust Wasteland", style_image_url = flywheel anchor,
no_background true, side view, light upper-left, then workbench repair+lint, crop/pad only)

## 5. Scene polish
- Composition: bbox x −172..198; crank at x 0 = focal centre; pistons top-left balance flywheel right. Keep MACHINE_ANCHOR.
- Contact shadows: 1–2 px strip #5f5244 α0.5 under frame base (x −100..100), plinth, pedestal feet; 3 px oval under flywheel rim gap.
- Scale: rivets 1 px everywhere; no part below 2 px detail; keep 2× only (no 1× sprites mixed).
- Depth/haze: pylons α .45 + tint #b8a98f; skyline α .4; mountains unchanged; no lattice behind frame at default camera.
- Lighting: light upper-left on static parts; rotating parts lit symmetrically; optional static rim overlay.
- HUD: toasts top-right column; never overlap y < −170 art at zoom 1.

## 6. Existing-asset defects
- gear-large: 12T (brief 16), module ≈4.7 px; gear-small: 8T, content only 28 px in 40 canvas (6 px empty border) → regen.
- piston-array: asymmetric, automotive pistons, floating valve → replace (block + yoke).
- support-frame: right post 6 px vs left 8 px; add mid-rail; otherwise good (keep).
- worn-motor, flywheel, hand-crank: crisp, palette-correct, keep; flywheel hub hole shows sky → cover with bearing cap/hub pulley.

Method: PixelLab create_image_pro (palette + anchor style, template reference) for pedestal, plinth, piston block,
bearing plate, ground; finalized by crop/pad, whole-pixel shifts, row/column duplication in uniform bands, re-inked edges.
Rotating parts (gears, 4 pulleys) are hand-pixelled to the exact module-4 / radius geometry (PixelLab candidates
shrank radii and changed tooth shapes) with radially symmetric shading (S3), one value step lighter than the frame
(face #5a5f63) for separation. piston-yoke hand-pixelled. Workbench score: gear-large 98.1, gear-small 95.0,
pulley-crank 99.1, pedestal 98.3, piston-block 95.9 (lint 0 errors).

Mesh verification (`scratchpad/ad/p2/meshtest.py`, centre distance 44, large 0°, pinion +22.5°):
static sprite overlap 0 px; pixel-raster analytic sweep over one tooth period 0 px; continuous 4× supersample 0 px²;
NEAREST-rotated sprite sweep ≤1 px in 7/30 frames (rounding only → use art-res RenderTexture per #7).
Tooth thickness at pitch 5.2 px (not 6) — needed for zero interference.

Notes for workers (no contract change):
- Depth: pistonYoke directly **behind** pistonBlock so rods slide into the glands (gland bottom y −132 = rod tip at BDC).
- Old `machine/piston-array.png` is left in place, unused once block+yoke are wired.
- Bearing plates are mostly hidden by main pulley (r10) / crank pulley (r15); still place them (visible pre-unlock / corners).
